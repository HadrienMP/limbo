# limbo
A limbo bash script inspired by : https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/limbo-on-the-cheap-e4cfae840330

- It will __continuously pull and push__ code.
- It can be useful when remote pairing/mobbing. The first developer can code for a given amount of time, commit, and the second developer gets the update code on their machine automatically.
- Try making __very small commits__ to get the most out of this technique
